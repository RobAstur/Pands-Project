# Iris data set analysis

***

## introduction

Iris is a genus of flowers with more than 300 species.  The iris data set was made famous by British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher. It contains 3 different types of iris flowers (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). It is one of the most popular datasets for data analytics. The aim of this project is to provide simple analysis with extensive research.

## Research

This research will use a double approach. On one side I will create my own data and charts. Based on that information I will compare results with different sources of information. Ont the other hand I will research fofr further and insightful information about the data set.

### Information from Histograms 

To better understand the anylisis it is important to open the different histograms while reading the information.
Website atlassian (Reference 5), defined histogram as " chart that plots the distribution of a numeric variable’s values as a series of bars. Each bar typically covers a range of numeric values called a bin or class; a bar’s height indicates the frequency of data points with a value within the corresponding bin."

###### Petal Length in cm

In this histogram we can see the highest frecuency in between 1.0 and 2.0 petal length cms. Around 50 subjects falls into this category. Comparing with more complex charts like the one provided by reference 6. We can see that, According with the information available the setosa flowers has the petals with the smaller length followed by versicolor. Finally the virginica have in general the petals with the highest legth. 

###### Petal width in cm

In this histogram we can see the highest frecuency in between 0.0 and 0.5 petal width cms. Around 45 subjects falls into this category. 

###### Sepal Length in cm

In this histogram we can see the highest frecuency in between 5.5 and 6.0 Sepal length cms. between 40 and 45 subjects falls into this category. 

###### Sepal Width in cm

In this histogram we can see the highest frecuency in between 3.0 and 3.5 Sepal lwidth cms. Aprox  65 subjects falls into this category. 

All the information provided in this section match reference number 4 info about histograms. The only difference is the number of bins used.
