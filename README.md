# Iris data set analysis

***

## introduction

Iris is a genus of flowers with more than 300 species.  The iris data set was made famous by British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher. It contains 3 different types of iris flowers (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). It is one of the most popular datasets for data analytics. The aim of this project is to provide simple analysis with extensive research.

## Research

This research will use a double approach. On one side I will create my own data and charts. Based on that information I will compare results with different sources of information. Ont the other hand I will research fofr further and insightful information about the data set.

### Information from Histograms 

To better understand the anylisis it is important to open the different histograms while reading the analysis.
Website atlassian **Reference 5**, defined histogram as " chart that plots the distribution of a numeric variable’s values as a series of bars. Each bar typically covers a range of numeric values called a bin or class; a bar’s height indicates the frequency of data points with a value within the corresponding bin."

The histograms of each of the features shows different frecuencies for each of the features. The key points are listed below.

* The etal lenght feature have the highest frecuency  between 1.0 and 2.0 cms. Aproximate 50 subjects falls in this category.
* The petal width feature shows the highest frequency in between 0.0 and 0.5 cms. Around 40 subjects falls in this category.
* The sepal lenghts feature have the highest frecuency in between 5.5 and 6.0. Between 40 and 45 subjects falls into this category
* The sepal width have highest frequency in between 3.0 and 3.5. Aproximate  65 subjects falls into this category

Above data is confirmed by **reference 4**

### Information from Scatterplot

To better understand the anylisis it is important to open the different scatterplots while reading the analysis.

Website atlassian **reference 6** defined scatter plot  as "A scatter plot (aka scatter chart, scatter graph) uses dots to represent values for two different numeric variables. The position of each dot on the horizontal and vertical axis indicates values for an individual data point. Scatter plots are used to observe relationships between variables."

The scatter charts provide veyr interesting information that can be see in below key points
