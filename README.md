# Iris data set analysis

***

## introduction

Iris is a genus of flowers with more than 300 species.  The iris data set was made famous by British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher. It contains 3 different types of iris flowers (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). It is one of the most popular datasets for data analytics. The aim of this project is to provide simple analysis with extensive research.

### Information form Histograms 

To better understand the anylisis it is important to open the different histograms while reading the information.
