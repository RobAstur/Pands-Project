### introduction

Iris is a genus of flowers with more than 300 species.  The iris data set was made famous by British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher. It contains 3 different types of iris flowers (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). It is one of the most popular datasets for data analytics.
